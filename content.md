###INTRO

Hello and welcome to OpenMind Odyssey. Do you have a cultural bias you're unaware of? Research shows 90% of us do and the statistics suggest there is still a ton of work to do in order to value each other equally.

We want to live in a world where we are not afraid to get things wrong, can acknowledge our mistakes without shame and work to unlearn our damaging behaviours. Learning to unlearn should be fun so lighten up, don't be scared and be ready with an open mind. Are you racist, ableist, sexist without realising?
